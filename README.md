# microbiome-gene-disease-integration_pipeline_1
Integration of microbiome species with gene and disease associations using Kraken2, GutMGene, and DisGeNET data to construct interactive biological networks in R

Perfect â€” hereâ€™s a **long GitHub repo description** that explains your project **step by step**, including the tools, data sources, and workflow.

### ðŸ“˜ **Long Description for GitHub Repository**

> This repository contains an R-based pipeline for integrating microbiome data with gene and disease associations to build a comprehensive **microbeâ€“geneâ€“disease network**. The workflow involves preprocessing microbiome taxonomic profiles from **Kraken2**, mapping microbes to genes using the **GutMGene** database, and linking genes to diseases using **DisGeNET**. The final result is an interactive, visualizable network that reveals potential biological relationships across multiple omics layers.

### ðŸ”„ **Workflow Overview**

#### **1. Microbiome Data Preprocessing**
- Load the Kraken2 report file containing taxonomic classification results.
- Filter and extract **species-level taxa** with their relative abundances.
- Save the cleaned microbiome data for further mapping.

#### **2. Microbeâ€“Gene Integration (GutMGene)**
- Download microbeâ€“gene association data from [GutMGene](http://bio-computing.hrbmu.edu.cn/gutmgene/#/home).
- Clean taxon names from Kraken2 (remove brackets, numbers, etc.).
- Match and map microbes from Kraken2 to associated genes in GutMGene.
- Save the **microbe â†’ gene** mapping.

#### **3. Geneâ€“Disease Integration (DisGeNET)**
- Download geneâ€“disease association files from [DisGeNET](https://disgenet.com/).
- Clean and extract gene symbols.
- Match gene symbols from GutMGene to those in DisGeNET.
- Integrate disease associations and save the **gene â†’ disease** mapping.

#### **4. Full Data Integration**
- Merge all three levels: **microbe â†’ gene â†’ disease**.
- Create a combined table showing relationships between microbiome species, gene IDs, and associated diseases with evidence scores.

#### **5. Network Visualization**
- Build the integrated network using `igraph` (static) and `visNetwork` (interactive).
- Nodes are colored by type (microbe, gene, disease).
- Edges are colored and weighted by association strength (DisGeNET score).
- Export the network to interactive **HTML files** for easy exploration and sharing.
